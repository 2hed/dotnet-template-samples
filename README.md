# .NET Template Samples

This repository contains samples of templates created using the [Template Engine](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/). Custom templates can be
used from `dotnet new` today. We are working on integrating these templates into Visaul Studio as well.

For more general info on `dotnet new`, and the Template Engine, see the following.
